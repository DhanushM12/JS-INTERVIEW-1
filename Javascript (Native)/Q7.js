// Q7. Give a relevant example of Promises
1. A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

2. As the Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises

3. Chained Promises

const myPromise =
  (new Promise(myExecutorFunc))
  .then(handleFulfilledA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC)
  .catch(handleRejectedAny);

  4. Another example
   let myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // We call resolve(...) when what we were doing asynchronously was successful, and reject(...) when it failed.
    // In this example, we use setTimeout(...) to simulate async code. 
    // In reality, you will probably be using something like XHR or an HTML5 API.
    setTimeout( function() {
      resolve("Success!")  // Yay! Everything went well!
    }, 250) 
  }) 
  
  myFirstPromise.then((successMessage) => {
    // successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve(...) function above.
    // It doesn't have to be a string, but if it is only a succeed message, it probably will be.
    console.log("Yay! " + successMessage) 
  });
